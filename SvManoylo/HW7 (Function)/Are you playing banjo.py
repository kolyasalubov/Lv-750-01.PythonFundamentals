# Given a list of numbers and a value n, write a function that returns the probability of choosing a number greater than or equal to n from the list. The probability should be expressed as a percentage, rounded to one decimal place.

# Notes. Precent probability of event = 100 * (num of favourable outcomes) / (total num of possible outcomes)
