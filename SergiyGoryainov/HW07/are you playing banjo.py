# Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
# If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!
#
# The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:
#
# name + " plays banjo"
# name + " does not play banjo"
# Names given are always valid strings.
